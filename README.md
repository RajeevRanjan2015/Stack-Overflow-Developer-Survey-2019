# 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Data Analysis:
The motivation behind this project is to do analysis of the Stack overflow developer survey 2019 using CRISP methodology. The purpose of the analysis is to find some of the burning questions of a developer who wished to choose any particular stream.

The objective of the analysis is centered around finding below questions:
 1. Which is the preffered programming language ?
 2. Which is the most used framework today?
 3. which is the most used tool by the data science professionals? 
 4. How about the chances of finding jobs when any non-developer moves to developing field?
 5. Which country provides best salary ?

#### The answer to above mentioned questions are explored keeping Data Science & Machine Learning specialist in mind.

### Summary:

Basically EDA (Exploratory data Analysis) is carried out on the stack overflow 2019 developer survey keeping data science and machine learning specialist in mind. The idea is that let's explore some of the burning questions before any data science aspirants today and try to answer some of those using the data.

Before going forwards let's agree on the analysis id restricted to basically 5 questions that were ,mentioned in the introduction itself.
I will be sharing the jupyter notebook having codes used for the analysis and the blog which is shared on the medium platform.

#### Results:
1. Python is the most used programming language by the data scientist followed by SQL.

2. jQuery, Flask, and Django are the most frequently used framework by the developers who identify themselves as Data scientist or ML specialist.

3.Pandas and Tensorflow are the most used data science tool today. Pandas crealy win the race by quite a bit margin. Pandas is preferred by almost 47% of the data science professional as most used tool for data analysis.

4.Clearly, maximum number of data science professional are having 2 yrs' of experience and also most of them started coding at 15 yrs' of age. So, any time in your career you can start learning coding and there are very good chances of finding job as well as we can see even less than 1 year of experienced data science professionals are also there in good number.

5. United state has maximum number od data scientists followed by India and Germany. Also United State has highest salary package for any data scientists.
